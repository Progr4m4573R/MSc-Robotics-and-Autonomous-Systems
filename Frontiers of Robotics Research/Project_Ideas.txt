Program a robot to take pictures, and fly to/ move to target in field.
improve facial recognition from pictures
low-cost arduino components
enables sending of picture remotely for drone to seek and navigate to
mx-chip to stream data to cloud database and app to access that data and upload to it
machine learning program to access that data on cloud database and navigate robot to target

Live feed object recognition to mobile app? possible distance measurements as well and dimensions
Implement GPS to prevent robot from getting "LOST"?

Existing drones with facial recognition: Larry Haller. THESE 4 DRONES CAN RECOGNISE YOUR FACE. Available at : https://www.dronesglobe.com/guide/face-recognition/ [Accessed: 08/03/2022]'

Questions:
BUILD a robot or use existing one? - Try to buy a drone if possible. 
MAke an app to send the pictures to an MXCHIP database or directly to Raspberry Pi or use bluetooth or some other means?
simple artifcat for demo - first make it easy and make the drone operate in a short distance.
Ask supervisor for budjet.

Test different algorithms for facial recognition. USe the drone to collect the dataset from a drone. Use other libraries and compare them to see which is the best.

Continue to test the code, are there other similar works in the area
=======
Use machine learning to make the drone learn the best height and angle to be at to accurately detect a human's face faster.

Best raspberry for face recognition:
Raspberry PI 4 model b- rent from uni? these can be expensive
