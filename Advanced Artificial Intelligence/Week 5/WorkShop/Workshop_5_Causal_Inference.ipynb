    "## EXAMPLE: Causal effect of rain on wet grass\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's consider again our Sprinkler network, assuming this is a reliable description of the causal relationships between its four variables:\n",
    "\n",
    "![Sprinkler example](sprinkler_dag_new.jpg)\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case we want to estimate the causal effects of the rain on the \"wetness\" of the grass.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that it wouldn't be physically possible to modify the rain variable $R$. Yet, we can use probabilities from observational data of the weather to compute its causal effect \"as if\" we were able to intervene on it.\n",
    "\n",
    "To this end, we can compute the effect of the intervention $P(G = true | do(R = true))$, or simply $P(g | do(r))$, by using the adjustment formula for the only parent of $R$, which is $C$:\n",
    "\n",
    "$\n",
    "\\begin{align*}\n",
    "P(g | do(r)) &= \\sum_{z \\in C} P(g | r, z) P(z) \\\\\n",
    "&= P(g | r, c) P(c) + P(g | r, \\neg c) P(\\neg c)\n",

    "$\n",
    "\n",
    "The probability distribution ${\\bf P}(C) = \\langle P(c), P(\\neg c) \\rangle$ is already given by the network. The conditional distribution ${\\bf P}(G | r, c) = \\langle P(g | r, c), P(\\neg g | r, c)\\rangle$ can be computed as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "$\n",
    "\\begin{align*}\n",
    "{\\bf P}(G | r, c) = \\dfrac{{\\bf P}(G, r, c)}{P(r, c)} = \\alpha {\\bf P}(G, r, c) &= \\alpha \\sum_s {\\bf P}(G, r, c, s) \\\\\n",
    "&= \\alpha \\sum_s P(c) P(r|c) P(s|c) {\\bf P}(G | r, s) \\\\\n",

    "$\n",
    "\n",
    "where in the last steps we moved the product $P(c) P(r|c)$ within the normalisation factor $\\alpha'$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Substituting the values from the netwrok's CPTs, we get the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "$\n",
    "{\\bf P}(G | r, c) = \\alpha' \\big[ 0.1 \\times \\langle 0.95, 0.05 \\rangle + 0.9 \\times \\langle 0.90, 0.10 \\rangle \\big] = \\langle 0.905, 0.095 \\rangle\n",
    "$\n",
    "\n",
    "If we do the same for the condition $\\neg c$, we obtain the following distribution:\n",
    "\n",
    "$\n",
    "{\\bf P}(G | r, \\neg c) = \\alpha' \\big[ 0.5 \\times \\langle 0.95, 0.05 \\rangle + 0.5 \\times \\langle 0.90, 0.10 \\rangle \\big] = \\langle 0.925, 0.075 \\rangle\n",
    "$\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, we use the calculated values, $P(g | r, c) = 0.905$ and $P(g | r, \\neg c) = 0.925$, in the previous adjustment formula and obtain the following:\n",
    "\n",
